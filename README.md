I am a front-end engineer, occasionally a designer, and a very serious person living in Brooklyn, NY, with 15+ years of experience building exceptional, high-quality websites and applications. I also have a graphic design background, tons of UI/UX design experience, and a curiously large knowledge of typography (seriously, let's talk about it). I prefer my barbecue sauce vinegar-based, and my metal heavy. Also, I like to run a lot (because of the barbecue).
